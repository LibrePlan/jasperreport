ABOUT
 * Since version 5 of ZK (www.zkoss.org) there are some components that are no longer free as they used to be on their latest stable release (version 3.6.4). One of those components is Jasperreport, used to render reports.

   This component is a fork from its GPL version at ZK 3.6.4 and initially used at LibrePlan (www.libreplan.org) but it's free to use and modify by whoever wants as it's released under the AGPL license (so remember to share your changes).

SUPPORTED REPORTS

 * Currently the only supported formats are:
      
      - PDF
      - ODT
      - HTML

 * If you add any other format and wish it to be added to the component please send me a patch

DEPENDENCIES

 * This component has dependencies with ZK and jasperreport. They are all setup on the pom file.
 * This component was built using ZK 5.0.5 but it might work with older reseales (not older than 5.0.0). Just change the <zk.version/> tag in the pom file to match your ZK version.

INSTALL

 * If you have maven (http://maven.apache.org/) installed on your computer just issue: mvn install
